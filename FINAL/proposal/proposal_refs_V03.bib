abstract = {Features of neighborhoods or residential environments may affect health and contribute to social and race/ethnic inequalities in health. The study of neighborhood health effects has grown exponentially over the past 15 years. This chapter summarizes key work in this area with a particular focus on chronic disease outcomes (specifically obesity and related risk factors) and mental health (specifically depression and depressive symptoms). Empirical work is classified into two main eras: studies that use census proxies and studies that directly measure neighborhood attributes using a variety of approaches. Key conceptual and methodological challenges in studying neighborhood health effects are reviewed. Existing gaps in knowledge and promising new directions in the field are highlighted.}

abstract = {Census data are widely used for assessing neighborhood socioeconomic context. Research using census data has been inconsistent in variable choice and usually limited to single geographic areas. This paper seeks to a) outline a process for developing a neighborhood deprivation index using principal components analysis and b) demonstrate an example of its utility for identifying contextual variables that are associated with perinatal health outcomes across diverse geographic areas. Year 2000 U.S. Census and vital records birth data (1998-2001) were merged at the census tract level for 19 cities (located in three states) and five suburban counties (located in three states), which were used to create eight study areas within four states. Census variables representing five socio-demographic domains previously associated with health outcomes, including income/poverty, education, employment, housing, and occupation, were empirically summarized using principal components analysis. The resulting first principal component, hereafter referred to as neighborhood deprivation, accounted for 51 to 73\% of the total variability across eight study areas. Component loadings were consistent both within and across study areas (0.2-0.4), suggesting that each variable contributes approximately equally to "deprivation" across diverse geographies. The deprivation index was associated with the unadjusted prevalence of preterm birth and low birth weight for white non-Hispanic and to a lesser extent for black non-Hispanic women across the eight sites. The high correlations between census variables, the inherent multidimensionality of constructs like neighborhood deprivation, and the observed associations with birth outcomes suggest the utility of using a deprivation, index for research into neighborhood effects on adverse birth outcomes.}

We sought to overcome these limitations by applying machine learning to electronic health records within a large medical database. Participants were 5,167 adult patients with a claim code for self-injury (i.e., {ICD}-9, E95x); expert review of records determined that 3,250 patients made a suicide attempt (i.e., cases), and 1,917 patients engaged in self-injury that was nonsuicidal, accidental, or nonverifiable (i.e., controls). We developed machine learning algorithms that accurately predicted future suicide attempts ({AUC} = 0.84, precision = 0.79, recall = 0.95, Brier score = 0.14). Moreover, accuracy improved from 720 days to 7 days before the suicide attempt, and predictor importance shifted across time. These findings represent a step toward accurate and scalable risk detection and provide insight into how suicide attempt risk shifts over time.}

The median sample size was 1,250 (range 72-3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5-563) and eight events per predictor (range 0.3-6,697). The most common {ML} methods were classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. In 48 (68\%) studies, we observed potential bias in the validation procedures. Sixty-four (90\%) studies used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) to assess discrimination. Calibration was not addressed in 56 (79\%) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between an {LR} and {ML} model ({AUC} range, 0.52-0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the difference in logit({AUC}) between {LR} and {ML} was 0.00 (95\% confidence interval, -0.18 to 0.18). For 137 comparisons at high risk of bias, logit({AUC}) was 0.34 (0.20-0.47) higher for {ML}. {CONCLUSION}: We found no evidence of superior performance of {ML} over {LR}.

We aimed to reduce hospital days for children from two high-morbidity, high-poverty neighborhoods in Cincinnati, Ohio, to narrow the gap between their neighborhoods and healthier ones. We also sought to use this population health improvement initiative to develop and refine a theory for how to narrow equity gaps across broader geographic areas. We relied upon quality improvement methods and a learning health system approach. Interventions included the optimization of chronic disease management; transitions in care; mitigation of social risk; and use of actionable, real-time data. The inpatient bed-day rate for the two target neighborhoods decreased by 18 percent from baseline (July 2012-June 2015) to the improvement phase (July 2015-June 2018). Hospitalizations decreased by 20 percent. There was no similar decrease in demographically comparable neighborhoods. We see the neighborhood as a relevant frame for achieving equity and building a multisector culture of health.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Neighborhood characteristics are important determinants of individual health and well-being. For example, characteristics such as noise and pollution affect health directly, while other characteristics affect health and well-being by either providing resources (e.g. social capital in the neighborhood), which individuals can use to cope with health problems, or limiting the use thereof (e.g. crime). This also suggests that there might be age differentials in the impact of these characteristics, since individuals at different stages of life might need different resources. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on age differentials in associations between well-being, health, and neighborhood characteristics. {OBJECTIVE}: This paper studies associations between a wide range of neighborhood characteristics with the health and well-being of residents of the greater Berlin area. In particular, we focus on differences in the effects between younger (aged 20-35) and older (aged 60+) residents. {METHODS}: We used data from the Berlin Aging Study {II} (312 younger and 993 older residents of the Berlin metropolitan area in Germany). We used survey data on health and well-being, combined these with subjective perceptions of the neighborhood, and geo-referenced indicators on the neighborhood, e.g. amenities (public transport, physicians, and hospitals). {RESULTS}: The results show that access to public transportation is associated with better outcomes on all measures of health and well-being, and social support is associated with higher life satisfaction and better mental health. There are considerable differences between both age groups: while the associations between access to public transport and health and well-being are similar for both age groups, neighborhood social capital shows stronger associations for older residents. However, the difference is not always statistically significant. {CONCLUSION}: Having access to services is associated with better health and well-being regardless of age. Local policy makers should focus on lowering barriers to mobility in order to improve the health and well-being of the population. Since the social capital of a neighborhood is associated with better health and well-being among older residents, investments that increase social capital (e.g. community centers) might be warranted in neighborhoods with higher shares of older residents. \copyright 2016 S.

Individual (age, sex, race/ethnicity, preferred language, insurance) and census tract-level (demographics, insurance, income, education, employment, occupation, household crowding and occupancy, built home environment, and transportation) variables were analyzed using linear mixed models predicting infection, hospitalization, and death from {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Among 57,865 individuals, per capita testing rates, individual (older age, male sex, non-White race, non-English preferred language, and non-private insurance), and census tract-level (increased population density, higher household occupancy, and lower education) measures were associated with likelihood of infection. Among those infected, individual age, sex, race, language, and insurance, and census tract-level measures of lower education, more multi-family homes, and extreme household crowding were associated with increased likelihood of hospitalization, while higher per capita testing rates were associated with decreased likelihood. Only individual-level variables (older age, male sex, Medicare insurance) were associated with increased mortality among those hospitalized. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study of the first wave of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic in a major U.S. city presents the cascade of outcomes following {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection within a large, multi-ethnic cohort. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and hospitalization rates, but not death rates among those hospitalized, are related to census tract-level socioeconomic characteristics including lower educational attainment and higher household crowding and occupancy, but not neighborhood measures of race, independent of individual factors.}

abstract = {{PURPOSE}: In designing a Project {ECHO\texttrademark} type 1 diabetes ({T1D}) program in Florida and California, the Neighborhood Deprivation Index ({NDI}) was used in conjunction with geocoding of primary care providers ({PCPs}) and endocrinologists in each state to concurrently identify areas with low endocrinology provider density and high health risk/poverty areas. The {NDI} measures many aspects of poverty proven to be critical indicators of health outcomes. {METHODS}: The data from the 2013-2017 American Community Survey ({ACS}) 5-year estimates were used to create {NDI} maps for California and Florida. In addition, geocoding and 30-minute drive-time buffers were performed using publicly available provider directories for {PCPs} and endocrinologists in both states by Google Geocoding {API} and the {TravelTime} Search Application Programming Interface ({API}). {RESULTS}: Based on these findings, we defined high-need catchment areas as areas with (1) more than a 30-minute drive to the nearest endocrinologist but within a 30-minute drive to the nearest {PCP}; (2) an {NDI} in the highest quartile; and (3) a population above the median (5199 for census tracts, and 1394 for census block groups). Out of the 12 181 census tracts and 34 490 census block groups in California and Florida, we identified 57 tracts and 215 block groups meeting these criteria as high-need catchment areas. {CONCLUSION}: Geospatial analysis provides an important initial methodologic step to effectively focus outreach efforts in diabetes program development. The integration of the {NDI} with geocoded provider directories enables more cost-effective and targeted interventions to reach the most vulnerable populations living with {T1D}. \copyright Endocrine Society 2020.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Clostridioides difficile infection ({CDI}) is commonly associated with outcomes like recurrence and readmission. The effect of social determinants of health, such as 'neighborhood' socioeconomic disadvantage, on a {CDI} patient's health outcomes is unclear. Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood could interfere with a {CDI} patient's ability to follow post-discharge care recommendations and the success probability of these recommendations, thereby increasing risk of readmission. We hypothesized that neighborhood disadvantage was associated with 30-day readmission risk in Medicare patients with {CDI}. {METHODS}: In this retrospective cohort study, odds of 30-day readmission for {CDI} patients are evaluated controlling for patient sociodemographics, comorbidities, and hospital and stay-level variables. The cohort was created from a random 20\% national sample of Medicare patients during the first 11 months of 2014. {RESULTS}: From the cohort of 19,490 patients (39\% male; 80\% white; 83\% 65 years or older), 22\% were readmitted within 30 days of an index stay. Unadjusted analyses showed that patients from the most disadvantaged neighborhoods were readmitted at a higher rate than those from less disadvantaged neighborhoods (26\% vs. 21\% rate: unadjusted {OR} = 1.32 [1.20, 1.45]). This relationship held in adjusted analyses, in which residence in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with 16\% increased odds of readmission (adjusted {OR} = 1.16 [1.04, 1.28]). {CONCLUSIONS}: Residence in disadvantaged neighborhoods poses a significantly increased risk of readmission in {CDI} patients. Further research should focus on in-depth assessments of this population to better understand the mechanisms underlying these risks and if these findings apply to other infectious diseases.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Stroke is a chronic cardiovascular disease that puts major stresses on U.S. health and economy. The prevalence of stroke exhibits a strong geographical pattern at the state-level, where a cluster of southern states with a substantially higher prevalence of stroke has been called the stroke belt of the nation. Despite this recognition, the extent to which key neighborhood characteristics affect stroke prevalence remains to be further clarified. {METHODS}: We generated a new neighborhood health data set at the census tract level on nearly 27,000 tracts by pooling information from multiple data sources including the {CDC}'s 500 Cities Project 2017 data release. We employed a two-stage modeling approach to understand how key neighborhood-level risk factors affect the neighborhood-level stroke prevalence in each state of the {US}. The first stage used a state-of-the-art Bayesian machine learning algorithm to identify key neighborhood-level determinants. The second stage applied a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach to describe how these key determinants explain the variability in stroke prevalence in each state. {RESULTS}: Neighborhoods with a larger proportion of older adults and non-Hispanic blacks were associated with neighborhoods with a higher prevalence of stroke. Higher median household income was linked to lower stroke prevalence. Ozone was found to be positively associated with stroke prevalence in 10 states, while negatively associated with stroke in five states. There was substantial variation in both the direction and magnitude of the associations between these four key factors with stroke prevalence across the states. {CONCLUSIONS}: When used in a principled variable selection framework, high-performance machine learning can identify key factors of neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke from wide-ranging information in a data-driven way. The Bayesian multilevel modeling approach provides a detailed view of the impact of key factors across the states. The identified major factors and their effect mechanisms can potentially aid policy makers in developing area-based stroke prevention strategies.}

We used 4 tree-based machine learning techniques to identify the most critical neighborhood-level factors in predicting the neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke, and compared their predictive performance for variable selection. We further quantified the effects of the identified determinants on stroke prevalence using a Bayesian linear regression model. Of the 5 most important predictors identified by our method, higher prevalence of low physical activity, larger share of older adults, higher percentage of non-Hispanic Black people, and higher ozone levels were associated with higher prevalence of stroke at the neighborhood level. Higher median household income was linked to lower prevalence. The most important interaction term showed an exacerbated adverse effect of aging and low physical activity on the neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke. Conclusions Tree-based machine learning provides insights into underlying drivers of neighborhood cardiovascular health by discovering the most important determinants from a wide range of factors in an agnostic, data-driven, and reproducible way. The identified major determinants and the interactive mechanism can be used to prioritize and allocate resources to optimize community-level interventions for stroke prevention.}

abstract = {Neighborhood socioeconomic conditions ({NSEC}) are associated with resident diet, but most research has been cross-sectional. We capitalize on a natural experiment where one neighborhood experienced substantial investments, compared to a sociodemographically similar neighborhood that did not, in order to examine pathways from neighborhood investments to changed {NSEC} and changed dietary behavior. We examine differences between renters and homeowners. Data are from a random sample of households (n=831) in each of these low-income Pittsburgh neighborhoods who were surveyed in 2011 and 2014. Structural equation modeling tested direct and indirect pathways from neighborhood to resident dietary quality, adjusting for individual-level sociodemographics, with multi-group testing by homeowners versus renters. Neighborhood investments were directly associated with improved dietary quality for both renters (\beta, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]) =0.27, {CI}: 0.05, 0.50) and homeowners (\beta=0.51, {CI}: 0.10, 0.92). Among renters, investments were also associated with dietary quality through a positive association with commercial prices (\beta= 0.34, {CI}: 0.15, 0.54) and a negative association with residential prices (\beta=-0.30, {CI}: -0.59, -0.004). Among homeowners, we did not observe any indirect pathways from investments to dietary quality through tested mediators. Investing in neighborhoods may support resident diet, doing so through improvements in neighborhood commercial environments for renters, but mechanisms appear to differ for homeowners. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

Consequently, identifying particular contextual factors that contribute to disparities is a public health goal. We study pediatric asthma emergency department ({ED}) visit disparities and neighborhood factors associated with them in South Carolina ({SC}) census tracts from 1999 to 2015. Leveraging a Bayesian framework, we identify risk clusters, spatially-varying relationships, and risk percentile-specific associations. Clusters of high risk occur in both rural and urban census tracts with high probability, with neighborhood-specific associations suggesting unique risk factors for each locale.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Interest in the usefulness of machine learning ({ML}) methods for outcomes prediction has continued to increase in recent years. However, the advantage of advanced {ML} model over traditional logistic regression ({LR}) remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the discrimination accuracy between {ML} models versus {LR} in predicting operative mortality following cardiac surgery. {METHODS}: The present systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. Discrimination ability was assessed using the C-statistic. Pooled C-statistics and its 95\% credibility interval for {ML} models and {LR} were obtained were obtained using a Bayesian framework. Pooled estimates for {ML} models and {LR} were compared to inform on difference between the 2 approaches. {RESULTS}: We identified 459 published citations of which 15 studies met inclusion criteria and were used for the quantitative and qualitative analysis. When the best {ML} model from individual study was used, meta-analytic estimates showed that {ML} were associated with a significantly higher C-statistic ({ML}, 0.88; 95\% credibility interval, 0.83-0.93 vs {LR}, 0.81; 95\% credibility interval, 0.77-0.85; P = .03). When individual {ML} algorithms were instead selected, we found a nonsignificant trend toward better prediction with each of {ML} algorithms. We found no evidence of publication bias (P = .70). {CONCLUSIONS}: The present findings suggest that when compared with {LR}, {ML} models provide better discrimination in mortality prediction after cardiac surgery. However, the magnitude and clinical influence of such an improvement remains uncertain. Copyright \copyright 2020 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Several machine learning ({ML}) algorithms have been increasingly utilized for cardiovascular disease prediction. We aim to assess and summarize the overall predictive ability of {ML} algorithms in cardiovascular diseases. A comprehensive search strategy was designed and executed within the {MEDLINE}, Embase, and Scopus databases from database inception through March 15, 2019. The primary outcome was a composite of the predictive ability of {ML} algorithms of coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias. Of 344 total studies identified, 103 cohorts, with a total of 3,377,318 individuals, met our inclusion criteria. For the prediction of coronary artery disease, boosting algorithms had a pooled area under the curve ({AUC}) of 0.88 (95\% {CI} 0.84-0.91), and custom-built algorithms had a pooled {AUC} of 0.93 (95\% {CI} 0.85-0.97). For the prediction of stroke, support vector machine ({SVM}) algorithms had a pooled {AUC} of 0.92 (95\% {CI} 0.81-0.97), boosting algorithms had a pooled {AUC} of 0.91 (95\% {CI} 0.81-0.96), and convolutional neural network ({CNN}) algorithms had a pooled {AUC} of 0.90 (95\% {CI} 0.83-0.95). Although inadequate studies for each algorithm for meta-analytic methodology for both heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias because the confidence intervals overlap between different methods, showing no difference, {SVM} may outperform other algorithms in these areas. The predictive ability of {ML} algorithms in cardiovascular diseases is promising, particularly {SVM} and boosting algorithms. However, there is heterogeneity among {ML} algorithms in terms of multiple parameters. This information may assist clinicians in how to interpret data and implement optimal algorithms for their dataset.}

abstract = {The short paper provides an overview on how geographic issues have become increasingly relevant to public health research and policy, particularly through the lens of geographic information systems ({GIS}). It covers six themes with an emphasis on methodological issues. (1) Our health-related behavior varies across geographic settings, so should public health policy. (2) Facilities (supply) and patients (demand) in a health care market interact with each other across geopolitical borders, and measures of health care accessibility need to capture that. (3) Our health outcome is the result of joint effects of individual attributes and neighborhood characteristics, and an adequate definition of neighborhood is critical for assessing neighborhood effect. (4) Disease rates in areas of small population are unreliable, and one effective way to mitigate the problem is to construct a larger, internally-homogenous and comparable area unit. (5) Defining a scientific geographic unit for health care market is critical for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to evaluate health care delivery, and {GIS} enables us to define the unit (e.g., primary care service areas, hospital service areas, and cancer service areas) automatically, efficiently and optimally. (6) Aside from various optimization objectives around "efficiency", it is as important to plan the location and allocation of health care resources toward maximum equality in health care access. Case studies are cited to illustrate each theme.}

We found publications discussing the potential of combined data to inform clinical care, target interventions, track population health and spark community partnerships with the goal of reducing health disparities and improving health equity.

However, poor adoption of mental health apps in the real world suggests that new approaches to optimising the quality of m-Health interventions are critically needed in order to realise the potential translational benefits for mental health support. The micro-randomised trial is an experimental approach for optimising and adapting m-Health resources. This trial design provides data to construct and optimise m-Health interventions. The data can be used to inform when and what type of m-Health interventions should be initiated, and thus serve to integrate interventions into daily routines with precision. Here, we illustrate this approach in a case study, review implementation issues that need to be considered while conducting an {MRT}, and provide a checklist for mental health m-Health intervention developers.}

abstract = {Neighborhood characteristics can have profound impacts on resident mental health, but the wide variability in methodologies used across studies makes it difficult to reach a consensus as to the implications of these impacts. The aim of this study was to simplify the assessment of neighborhood influence on mental health. We used a factor analysis approach to reduce the multi-dimensional assessment of a neighborhood using census tracts and demographic data available from the American Community Survey ({ACS}). Multivariate quantitative characterization of the neighborhood was derived by performing a factor analysis on the 2011-2015 {ACS} data. The utility of the latent variables was examined by determining the association of these factors with poor mental health measures from the 500 Cities Project 2014-2015 data (2017 release). A five-factor model provided the best fit for the data. Each factor represents a complex multi-dimensional construct. However, based on heuristics and for simplicity we refer to them as (1) Affluence, (2) Singletons in Tract, (3) African Americans in Tract, (4) Seniors in Tract, and (5) Hispanics or Latinos in Tract. African Americans in Tract (with loadings showing larger numbers of people who are black, single moms, and unemployed along with fewer people who are white) and Affluence (with loadings showing higher income, education, and home value) were strongly associated with poor mental health (R2=0.67, R2=0.83). These findings demonstrate the utility of this factor model for future research focused on the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and resident mental health.}
