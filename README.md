## Organization and Style
This repository uses the following description for file organization and coding style:

### File Organization:
This repository organizes file by project specfic topics and generic folders<br>
Project specfic topic descriptions are included in the README<br>
Generic folders may include the following based on the needs of the repository:<br>
`_code` Code scripts used by multiple projects<br>
`_fig` Figures used by multiple projects<br>
`_data` Data files use dmy multiple projects<br>
`_archive` Old files no longer used<br>
`_refs` References, literature, or documentation files<br>

### File Names:
File names use 2-6 letter label based on the file content followed by standard prefixes and suffixes<br>
Template: `topic_version_suffix.ext`<br>
Greek alphabet is used to represent file versions:<br>
`alpha_`, `beta_`, `gamma_`... `omega_`<br> 
Standard suffixes represent the following types of files:<br>
`_code` Development code script for working in an IDE<br>
`_book` Jupyter notebook <br>
`_stage` Data files that have been modified from raw source<br>
`_2020-01-01` Text scripts with results output with date it was run<br>
`_map` 2D geographic display<br>
`_graph` 2D chart or graph representing numeric data

### Variable Names:
Python and R code scripts use the following variable naming conventions:<br>
`xx` 2-6 letter abbrevation based on content within data object<br>
`df_xx` Pandas and R dataframes<br>
`l_xx` Pandas and R lists<br>
`v_xx` R vectors<br>
`a_xx` Numpy arrays<br>
`m_xx` Numpy or R matrices<br>
`df_X` feature tables <br>
`df_Y` target tables <br>

### PEP-8 Standards:
Whenever possible code scripts follow PEP-8 standards<br>
Wihtin these standards, scripts use the following elective options:<br>
`=` for variable defintions (no `<-`)<br>
`''` for all character strings or arguments (no `""`) <br>
A single space is provided between each element (ex. `columns = 'ColA'`)<br>
